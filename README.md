# @alexdaiii/mini-nxjs-cls

@alexdaiii/mini-nxjs-cls is a simple graph theory library for JavaScript. It implements basic graph theory algorithms
on unweighted graphs. Graph algorithms are implemented in an

## Installation

```bash
npm install @alexdaiii/mini-nxjs-cls
```

## Usage

@alexdaiii/mini-nxjs-cls only implements two types of graphs: `DirectedGraph` and `UndirectedGraph`.

These graphs are unweighted, do not allow self-loops, and do not allow parallel edges.
